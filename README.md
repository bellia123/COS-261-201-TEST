Online Java Compiler: Programiz
NOTE: Comments are lines in codes that are ignored by the Java compiler. They are meant for us humans â€” to explain what the code does, why certain decisions were made, or to make it easier for developers and anyone else  to understand later. All codes have comments added to them for better clarity.
Basics & Syntax
1. Write a Java program to print "Hello, World!".

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


2. Explain the difference between == and .equals() in Java.
In Java:
== compares if two references point to the same object in memory
.equals() compares the content or values of objects
Example:
public class EqualsVsEqual {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = new String("UNN");
        String s2 = new String("UNN");
        
        // Using == (compares references)
        System.out.println("s1 == s2: " + (s1 == s2)); // false
        
        // Using equals() (compares values)
        System.out.println("s1.equals(s2): " + s1.equals(s2)); // true
    }
}

3. What is the use of the main method in Java?
The main method serves as the entry point for any Java application. When you run a Java program, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) looks for the main method to start execution. It must have the exact signature:
public static void main(String[] args)
4. Write a Java program to add two numbers entered by the user.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class AddNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();
        
        double sum = num1 + num2;
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        
        input.close();
    }
}

5. What is the difference between int, Integer, and String?
int: A primitive data type that stores whole numbers (no decimals)
Integer: A wrapper class for the primitive type int that provides methods to perform operations
String: A class that represents a sequence of characters
Control Structures
6. Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class EvenOdd {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = input.nextInt();
        
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println(num + " is even");
        } else {
            System.out.println(num + " is odd");
        }
        
        input.close();
    }
}

7. Write a program to find the largest among three numbers.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LargestNumber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = input.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = input.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.print("Enter third number: ");
        double num3 = input.nextDouble();
        
        double largest = num1;
        
        if (num2 > largest) {
            largest = num2;
        }
        
        if (num3 > largest) {
            largest = num3;
        }
        
        System.out.println("Largest number: " + largest);
        
        input.close();
    }
}

8. Explain the difference between while, for, and do-while loops in Java.
while loop: Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked before executing the block.
for loop: Used when you know how many times you want to execute a block of code.
do-while loop: Similar to while loop, but the condition is checked after executing the block once (guarantees at least one execution).
9. Write a Java program to print the multiplication table of any number.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class MultiplicationTable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        int num = input.nextInt();
        
        System.out.println("Multiplication table of " + num + ":");
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
            System.out.println(num + " x " + i + " = " + (num * i));
        }
        
        input.close();
    }
}

OOP Concepts
10. Explain the four pillars of OOP in Java.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.
Inheritance: The ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.
Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms or data types (method overloading and overriding).
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
11. Create a class Student with properties name, matricNo, and score, and add methods to display the student's info.

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private String matricNo;
    private double score;
    
    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, String matricNo, double score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.matricNo = matricNo;
        this.score = score;
    }
    
    // Method to display student information
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Student Information:");
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Matric No: " + matricNo);
        System.out.println("Score: " + score);
    }
    
    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student student = new Student("Chidi Okonkwo", "UNN/2023/012345", 85.5);
        student.displayInfo();
    }
}


12. What is method overloading? Give a code example.
Method overloading is when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different number or types of parameters).
public class MethodOverloading {
    // Method with two parameters
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    // Method with three parameters
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
    
    // Method with different parameter types
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MethodOverloading calc = new MethodOverloading();
        
        System.out.println("Sum of 5 and 10: " + calc.add(5, 10));
        System.out.println("Sum of 5, 10, and 15: " + calc.add(5, 10, 15));
        System.out.println("Sum of 5.5 and 10.5: " + calc.add(5.5, 10.5));
    }
}

13. What is inheritance? Create a base class Person and a subclass Teacher.
Inheritance is an OOP concept where a class (subclass) can inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).

// Base class
public class Person {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;
    
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

// Subclass
public class Teacher extends Person {
    private String subject;
    
    public Teacher(String name, int age, String subject) {
        super(name, age);  // Call the constructor of the superclass
        this.subject = subject;
    }
    
    // Override the displayInfo method
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo();  // Call the displayInfo method of the superclass
        System.out.println("Subject: " + subject);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Teacher teacher = new Teacher("Prof. Adebayo", 45, "Computer Science");
        teacher.displayInfo();
    }
}

General Practices
14. What does it mean to write "clean code"? Give 3 practices that make code clean and maintainable.
Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Three practices for clean code:
Meaningful names: Use descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes that clearly indicate their purpose.
Small functions/methods: Keep methods short and focused on a single task to make them easier to understand and test.
Consistent formatting: Follow consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions throughout the codebase.
15. Why should you avoid writing very long methods in Java programs?
Long methods should be avoided because:
They are hard to read and understand
They often perform multiple tasks, violating the Single Responsibility Principle
They are difficult to test, debug, and maintain
They often contain duplicate code and high complexity
16. What naming conventions should be followed in Java for: Classes, Variables, Methods.
In Java:
Classes: Start with uppercase letter, use CamelCase (e.g., StudentRecord, BankAccount)
Variables: Start with lowercase letter, use camelCase (e.g., firstName, totalAmount)
Methods: Start with lowercase letter, use camelCase (e.g., calculateTotal(), getName())
java code
public class BankAccount {  // Class name starts with uppercase
    private double accountBalance;  // Variable starts with lowercase
    private String accountHolder;
    
    public double getBalance() {  // Method starts with lowercase
        return accountBalance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        accountBalance += amount;
    }
}

17. What is the importance of breaking your Java program into methods?
Breaking programs into methods is important because:
Improves code organization and readability
Enables code reuse and reduces duplication
Makes code easier to test and debug
Follows the Single Responsibility Principle (each method does one thing well)
Makes maintaining and modifying the program easier
18. Explain the concept of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) with a Java code example.
DRY means avoiding code duplication by creating reusable components.
Example with code duplication:
javacode
public class NotDRY {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calculate area of first rectangle
        double length1 = 5.0;
        double width1 = 3.0;
        double area1 = length1 * width1;
        System.out.println("Rectangle 1 area: " + area1);
        
        // Calculate area of second rectangle
        double length2 = 7.0;
        double width2 = 4.0;
        double area2 = length2 * width2;
        System.out.println("Rectangle 2 area: " + area2);
    }
}

DRY version with a reusable method:
javacode
public class DRY {
    // Reusable method to calculate rectangle area
    public static double calculateRectangleArea(double length, double width) {
        return length * width;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Calculate area of first rectangle
        double area1 = calculateRectangleArea(5.0, 3.0);
        System.out.println("Rectangle 1 area: " + area1);
        
        // Calculate area of second rectangle
        double area2 = calculateRectangleArea(7.0, 4.0);
        System.out.println("Rectangle 2 area: " + area2);
    }
}

19. What are the benefits of using classes and objects instead of writing all logic in the main method?
Benefits include:
Better organization and structure of code
Reusability of code across different parts of the program
Encapsulation of data and operations together
Makes large programs more manageable
Promotes modular design and separation of concerns
Easier to maintain and extend the functionality
Testing & Debugging
20. Why is testing important during program development?
Testing is important because:
It helps identify bugs and issues early in development
Ensures that the application works as expected
Provides confidence in the reliability of the code
Facilitates refactoring without introducing new bugs
Serves as documentation for how the code should work
Reduces the cost of fixing bugs compared to finding them in production
21. What is the difference between syntax error, runtime error, and logic error?
Syntax Error: Error in the program's code structure (grammar) that prevents compilation. Example: missing semicolon, unmatched brackets.
Runtime Error: Occurs during program execution and causes the program to terminate abnormally. Example: division by zero, null pointer exception.
Logic Error: The program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic. Example: using < instead of >, incorrect algorithm implementation.
22. How would you test a method that calculates the average of five numbers?
javacode
public class AverageCalculator {
    // Method to calculate average
    public static double calculateAverage(double[] numbers) {
        if (numbers.length == 0) {
            return 0.0;
        }
        
        double sum = 0.0;
        for (double num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        
        return sum / numbers.length;
    }
    
    // Test method
    public static void testCalculateAverage() {
        // Test case 1: Regular numbers
        double[] test1 = {10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0};
        double expected1 = 30.0;
        double result1 = calculateAverage(test1);
        System.out.println("Test 1: " + (Math.abs(result1 - expected1) < 0.0001 ? "PASSED" : "FAILED"));
        
        // Test case 2: Negative numbers
        double[] test2 = {-10.0, -20.0, -30.0, -40.0, -50.0};
        double expected2 = -30.0;
        double result2 = calculateAverage(test2);
        System.out.println("Test 2: " + (Math.abs(result2 - expected2) < 0.0001 ? "PASSED" : "FAILED"));
        
        // Test case 3: Mixed numbers
        double[] test3 = {-10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0};
        double expected3 = 10.0;
        double result3 = calculateAverage(test3);
        System.out.println("Test 3: " + (Math.abs(result3 - expected3) < 0.0001 ? "PASSED" : "FAILED"));
        
        // Test case 4: Empty array
        double[] test4 = {};
        double expected4 = 0.0;
        double result4 = calculateAverage(test4);
        System.out.println("Test 4: " + (Math.abs(result4 - expected4) < 0.0001 ? "PASSED" : "FAILED"));
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testCalculateAverage();
    }
}

Documentation & Comments
23. Why should Java developers write comments in their code?
Java developers should write comments to:
Explain complex logic or algorithms
Provide context that is not obvious from the code
Help other developers understand the code's purpose and usage
Document assumptions, limitations, or special considerations
Make future maintenance easier, even for the original developer
24. What are JavaDoc comments and how are they different from regular comments?
JavaDoc comments are special comments used to generate API documentation automatically:
They start with /** and end with */
They support special tags like @param, @return, @throws
They are associated with classes, methods, and fields
They are processed by the JavaDoc tool to generate HTML documentation
Regular comments (// or /* */) are ignored by the compiler and not used for documentation generation.
25. Write a sample Java method with JavaDoc comments.
javacode
/**
 * Calculates the area of a rectangle.
 * 
 * @param length The length of the rectangle in meters.
 * @param width The width of the rectangle in meters.
 * @return The area of the rectangle in square meters.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If either length or width is negative.
 */
public double calculateRectangleArea(double length, double width) {
    if (length < 0 || width < 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Length and width must be non-negative");
    }
    return length * width;
}

Versioning & Collaboration
26. What is version control and why is it important in team projects?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing developers to recall specific versions later. It's important in team projects because:
It enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously
It tracks changes, showing who made what changes and why
It provides backup and history of all changes
It facilitates code review and quality control
It allows for branching and merging of features
It simplifies deployment and rollback processes
27. How would you explain the concept of "code refactoring" to a junior developer?
Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. It's like renovating a house - you're improving its structure and organization without changing its appearance from the outside.
To a junior developer, I would explain:
Refactoring makes code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to maintain
It should be done incrementally, with testing after each change
Common refactoring techniques include: extracting methods, renaming variables for clarity, removing duplicate code
It's not about adding new features, but improving how existing features are implemented
Refactoring should be a regular part of development, not just a one-time activity
28. What tools can Java developers use to collaborate on large projects?
Three examples of collaboration tools for Java developers:
Git/GitHub: Version control system and platform for code hosting, review, and collaboration
Maven/Gradle: Build automation tools that manage dependencies and project structure
Jenkins: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool for automated testing and deployment
Good Practices Summary
29. Mention 5 best practices you follow when developing a Java program.
Follow naming conventions: Use meaningful, clear names for variables, methods, and classes
Write modular code: Break down complex functionality into smaller, reusable methods
Handle exceptions properly: Use try-catch blocks and create custom exceptions when appropriate
Write unit tests: Test individual components to ensure they work correctly
Document your code: Add comments and JavaDoc to explain complex logic and API usage
30. What is code readability, and why is it more important than "smart" code?
Code readability refers to how easily developers can understand code just by reading it. It's more important than "smart" (clever but complex) code because:
Readable code is easier to maintain and debug
Most code is read many more times than it is written
Teams can collaborate more effectively with readable code
Readable code reduces the time needed for new developers to understand the codebase
"Smart" code often uses tricks that are difficult for others to understand and maintain
Mini Projects / Logic Building
31. Build a command-line application that keeps track of student grades.
Student Grade Management System
